> ## Software
>
> We will be use [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com/) in this workshop,
> however you may prefer to install a separate desktop application. To interact
> with spreadsheets, we can use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/),
> Microsoft Excel, [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/),
> [Onlyoffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/), [WPS office](https://www.wps.com/)
> or other programs. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general
ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.
