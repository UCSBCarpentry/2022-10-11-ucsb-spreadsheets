## Date formats in spreadsheets

Dates in spreadsheets are often stored in a single column. 

While this seems like a logical way to record dates when you are entering them, or visually reviewing data, it's not actually a best practice for preparing data for analysis.

When working with data, your goal is to have as little ambiguity as possible. Ambiguity can creep into your data when working with dates when there are regional variations either in your observations and when you or your team might be working with different versions or suites of software products (e.g., Google Sheets, LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric).

To avoid ambiguity between regional differences in date formatting and compatibility across spreadsheet software programs, a good practice is to divide dates into components in different columns - DAY (DD), MONTH (MM), and YEAR (YYYY). 

When working with dates it's also important to remember that functions are guaranteed to be compatible only within the same family of software products. If you need to export your data and conserve the timestamps, you are better off handling dates using the ISO format we will cover in a bit.

One of the other reasons dates can be tricky is that most spreadsheet programs have “useful features” which can change the way dates are displayed - but not stored. The image below demonstrates some of the many date formatting options.

## Dates stored as integers

The first thing you need to know is that as most spreadsheets programs, Google Sheets stores dates as numbers - see the last column in the above figure. This serial number represents the number of days from December 31, 1899. In the example, July 2, 2014 is stored as the serial number 41822.

> - Inputs to `DATE` must always be numbers - if a string or a reference to a cell containing a string is provided, the `#VALUE!` error will be returned.
> - DATE will silently recalculate numeric dates which fall outside of valid month or day ranges. For example, DATE(1969,13,1), which specifies the illegal month 13, will create a date of 1/1/1970. Similarly, DATE(1969,1,32), which specifies the non-existent 32nd day of January, will create a date of 2/1/1969.
> - Google Sheets uses the 1900 date system. The first date is 1/1/1900.
> - Between 0 and 1899, Google Sheets adds that value to 1900 to calculate the year. 
> - For years less than 1900 or greater than 10,000, Google Sheets will return the #NUM! error value

Using functions we can  add days, months or years to a given date.
Say you had a research plan where you needed to conduct interviews with a
set of informants every ninety days for a year.

In our example above, in a new cell you could type:

~~~
=B2+90
~~~
{: .code}

And it would return

~~~
30-Sep

## Regional date formatting

When you enter a date into a spreadsheet it looks like a date although the spreadsheet program may
display different text from what you input. It does this to be 'helpful' but it often is not. 

For example if you enter '7/12/88' into a
Excel spreadsheet it may display as '07/12/1988' (depending on your version of Excel). These
are different ways of formatting the same date.

Different countries also write dates differently. If you are in the UK or Brazil, for example, you will interpret
the date above as the 7th day of December, however a researcher from the US will interpret the same entry as the 12th day of July. This regional variation is handled automatically by your
spreadsheet program so that when you are typing in dates they appear as you would expect. If you
try to type in a US format date into a UK or BR version of Excel, it may or may not be treated as a
date.

This regional variation is one good reason to treat dates, not as a single data point, but as
three distinct pieces of data. Separating dates into their component parts
will avoid this confusion, while also giving the added benefit of allowing you to compare, for
example data collected in January of multiple years with data collected in February of multiple years.

> ## ISO 8601
> If you choose keeping all date elements in one cell, to avoid regional conflicts, we recommend you use the International Standard Organization (ISO) 8601 format for dates which represents date and time by starting with the year, followed by the month, the day, the hour, the minutes, seconds and milliseconds. For example, 2020-07-10 15:00:00.000, represents the 10th of July 2020 at 3 p.m. (in local time as there is no time zone offset specified. Remember to note the use of the standard in your dataset documentation.

## Historical data
As Excel, Google Sheets is unable to parse dates from before 1899-12-31, and will thus leave these untouched.  If you’re mixing historic data
from before and after this date, it will translate only the post-1900 dates into its internal format, thus resulting in mixed data. If you’re working with historic data, be extremely careful with your dates!

For historical dates, it is best practice to follow the advice for separating dates into components above and use a numerical value that is positive or negative depending on the era. For dates that are before the Common Era (often abbreviated as B.C.E/BCE, or older nomenclature as B.C./BC), the years should be  represented as negative values, while dates after 0 (abbreviated CE/C.E. or AD/A.D.) should be represented as positive values. For example, the date of March 15, 44 BCE in `Day`, `Month`, and `Year` columns could look like: `15`,`3`,`-44`.
